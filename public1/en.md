### **Break Free from Platform Dependency! Build Your Foreign Trade Digital Future with Independent Sites and AI**

Friends, welcome to the sharing session on "Independent Sites and AI Empowering New Growth in Foreign Trade." Today, we want to explore a topic crucial to our future: in this era of transformative change, how can we break free from the old cycles and build a solid, autonomous digital future for our foreign trade businesses?

Before we begin, let's outline today's roadmap. We'll start from the most tangible current situation, examining the gains and losses between us and the platforms. Then, we'll delve into why **now** is the best time to make a change. Next, I will break down a clear implementation path, showing how to build your own digital castle step by step. Finally, we will jointly envision the entirely new business landscape that lies at the end of this path.

**I. Predicament and Awakening: From "Traffic Tenants" to "Asset Owners"**

We have all lived within the ecosystem of platforms. Those days are still fresh in our memory: the first thing every day was to check rankings, fight for ad space, and struggle to cope with ever-changing rules. It was like farming diligently on rented land; the harvest seemed good, but the land never belonged to us. A sudden policy change or an unavoidable account issue could wipe out years of hard work.

The more pressing dilemma is profit. Some sellers have carefully calculated: for every ten yuan in sales revenue, two to three yuan must be paid to the platform as commissions, and another one to two yuan must be invested in advertising to buy traffic. What finally ends up in their own pockets is often only half, or even less. The predicament of "working for the platform" is something I believe each of us here has personally experienced.

But today, we have the opportunity to break free from this cycle. The key lies in redefining what truly constitutes our own assets. Traffic comes and goes; but the accumulated customer data, the deeply ingrained brand recognition, and the stable, trusted user relationships—these are the precious assets that appreciate over time and truly belong to us.

Please imagine: when you own your independent site, every visitor's browsing history, every piece of interaction data, every customer's email address is firmly in your own hands. You can talk directly to customers without any intermediaries; you can freely tell your brand story without being drowned out in a sea of similar products. More importantly, these assets continuously accumulate, like a snowball, growing larger and larger.

A seller I recently met resolutely transitioned to an independent site three years ago. Today, seventy percent of his orders come from repeat purchases by old customers, his overall marketing costs have decreased by forty percent, and his profit margin has increased by twenty percent. He told me that what gives him the most peace of mind is no longer worrying about waking up to an account problem that zeroes his business overnight.

This is the fundamental shift from a "traffic mindset" to an "asset mindset." It's the transition from being a "tenant" on someone else's land to becoming the "city lord" building your own domain.

**II. Restructuring the Landscape: The Shifts and Games of Various Players**

As we resolve to change, let's first clearly see the changes across the entire board. In this transformation, every participant is repositioning themselves.

Let's start with the platforms we know best. They are still powerful, with countless transactions occurring on them daily. But change is quietly happening. Some highly successful sellers I know have already started launching new products and core items on their own independent sites for initial release and primary sales, using platforms more for clearing inventory. What does this mean? Platforms are being demoted from the "sole main battlefield" to just "one of many channels."

More importantly, the platforms' control is relatively declining. When sellers no longer stake their entire fortunes on a platform, its rules cease to be absolute "divine laws" that must be obeyed. We have gained more choices and a stronger voice.

As for us sellers, we are now at a crossroads deciding our destiny. Sellers who choose to remain deeply dependent on platforms may have to face this reality: advertising costs are rising by about twenty percent annually, profit margins might be squeezed to just ten percent, and the risk to account security hangs over their heads like a sword. It's like living in a beautifully decorated house owned by someone else; the landlord's word can force you to move out.

Those peers who choose independent sites see a completely different landscape. They are beginning to accumulate their own customer lists; some have already collected tens of thousands of high-quality customer emails, where a single targeted email campaign can generate hundreds of thousands in sales. More importantly, they can communicate directly with customers, obtain the most genuine product feedback, and achieve repeat purchase rates of over thirty percent. I know a home goods seller who, by deeply serving a group of core customers, increased their average order value by threefold.

The entire service ecosystem is also undergoing drastic restructuring. Traditional platform operation agencies are finding business increasingly difficult. Meanwhile, talent skilled in independent site operation and AI tools commands salary increases exceeding the industry average by thirty percent. Companies providing SaaS site-building tools have seen their business volume multiply in recent years.

Even consumers are changing. They are increasingly willing to shop on brand websites because they hope to hear more complete product stories and enjoy more personalized, attentive service.

This is the ongoing, irreversible restructuring of the landscape.

**III. The Opportunity of the Era: Why Now is a Historic Window?**

After understanding the current situation, we can't help but ask: Why now? The answer is that several key factors are creating perfect resonance at this moment.

First is the **democratization of technology**. Think back five years: building a professional, stable independent site might have required an investment of over a hundred thousand yuan or more, plus assembling a professional technical team. Now, for just a few hundred yuan per month, using mature SaaS site-building tools, it can be easily accomplished. Even more critical is the explosive maturation of AI. In the past, a product description might have required a copywriter to revise for a full day; now, using AI tools, dozens of high-quality variations in different styles can be generated in minutes. A designer might have completed only a few images per day, whereas now, using AI image generation tools, hundreds of creative assets can be produced in an hour. The technical barrier has been significantly lowered.

Second is the **complete opening of traffic sources**. In the past, our vision was confined within the platforms, fighting for that limited "plot of land." Now, through social media (like short videos on TikTok), a single viral piece of content can bring hundreds of thousands, even millions, of impressions. Through professional content marketing, a high-quality industry article can bring you precise customers continuously for years via Google. We have one client whose independent site gets sixty percent of its traffic from social media, thirty percent from search engines, and only ten percent relies on paid advertising. This healthy, diversified traffic structure was unimaginable in the platform era.

Furthermore, there is the **fundamental awakening of our seller mindset**. Three years ago, industry chatter was all about "how to grab rankings and create hit products on platforms." Now, everyone is discussing more about "how to build their own customer pools" and "how to enhance brand loyalty." This mindset shift from "tenant" to "landowner" is the most fundamental and important driving force. I know a seller who, after experiencing the deep pain of a platform account ban costing him over a million, resolutely committed fully to an independent site. He now tells me this is the most soundly he has slept in a long time.

Finally, the **migration of consumer preferences** also provides us with fertile ground. Young buyers today, especially in overseas markets, are no longer satisfied with simple price comparisons. They are more willing to pay for brands with stories, warmth, and values. They enjoy the feeling of interacting directly with the brand and crave deeper emotional connections.

These factors, combined, have created this unprecedented, historic window of opportunity.

**IV. Implementation Path: Four Steps to Build Your Digital Asset Edifice**

Understanding the "why," the next most crucial step is the "how." Building digital assets is like constructing a building; it requires steady, step-by-step progress.

**Step One: Lay the Foundation – Asset Construction.** This refers to building your independent site and populating it with core content. Building the site itself is now very simple. The key lies in content creation, and AI is an indispensable assistant here. From the overall framework and copy of the website to the detailed descriptions, brand stories, and blog posts for every product, AI can generate large volumes of high-quality drafts in a very short time, improving efficiency by orders of magnitude.

**Step Two: Channel the Flow – Asset Appreciation.** Once the foundation is laid, the next step is to help customers find you, i.e., driving traffic. Here, AI can also play a significant role. It can help you analyze where your target customer groups are distributed, what kind of content they prefer, and even automatically generate and optimize ad copy for different channels. One of our clients, using AI for ad campaign analysis, reduced their click cost by thirty percent while doubling their conversion rate. Traffic from social media, search engines, and content platforms begins to flow continuously into your website.

**Step Three: Convert and Retain – Asset Monetization.** This is the most critical step in transforming public traffic into your privately owned assets. You can offer valuable content (like an industry white paper or an exclusive tutorial) in exchange for a visitor's email address. When a customer inquires or places an order, an AI客服 can provide professional, instant responses 24/7, ensuring no potential sales opportunity is lost. We have observed that sellers who successfully accumulate email lists of a hundred thousand or more can achieve stable annual sales in the millions just through regular email marketing.

**Step Four: Cycle of Growth – Asset Multiplication.** This is the stage where the entire system achieves self-operation and a flywheel effect. Through marketing automation tools, when a customer adds a product to their cart but doesn't checkout, the system automatically sends a thoughtful reminder email; based on the customer's browsing and purchase history, the system automatically recommends new products they might be interested in. One of our sellers, using such an automated process, increased the proportion of repeat purchases from old customers to forty percent, with a further fifteen percent of new customers coming directly from referrals and recommendations by existing customers.

This process might initially feel like pushing a snowball, requiring some effort. But once the snowball starts rolling and gains its own momentum, growth becomes increasingly effortless. Your customer list, brand recognition, and user relationships—these core assets—appreciate automatically for you every day.

**V. The Future Landscape: The Qualitative Change and Renewal Brought by Digital Assets**

So, what does the scenery look like if we persist down this path?

For sellers, the most direct change is the **fundamental transformation of the business model**. A friend who spent eight years on platforms told me that life before was like scrambling for limited-time offers every day—those who were quick got them, those who were slow missed out—and it was utterly exhausting. Now, sixty percent of the orders on his independent site come from old customers, and his profit margin is fifty percent higher than on platforms. Most crucially, he can settle down and focus on long-term product planning and brand building, no longer anxious about sudden external policy changes.

The entire **industry ecosystem is also being reshuffled**. A very interesting phenomenon is the emergence of numerous "small but beautiful" brands in recent years. They might focus exclusively on an extremely niche category, like specializing in outdoor camping lights or only offering designer tableware. These brands reach global customers directly through their independent sites; some teams have only three to five people but achieve annual sales reaching tens of millions. This was hard to imagine in the era dominated by platforms.

For **entrepreneurs and individuals**, the door of opportunity has never been wider. The "one-person company" model is becoming feasible. I know a mother who, using fragmented time while caring for her family, sells her self-designed handicrafts through an independent site, now steadily earning over a hundred thousand yuan monthly, truly achieving a balance between work and family. Such cases are becoming more and more common.

The future **competitive landscape** will be entirely different. Large sellers rely on scale and supply chain advantages, while smaller sellers leverage unique brand identities and deep service. Everyone is no longer squeezed into the same arena for a melee but is cultivating their own lane. A friend in the pet supplies business put it well: "Now the competition isn't about who is better at fighting on platforms, but who understands users better, whose service is more caring and warm."

This is the qualitative change triggered once digital assets accumulate to a certain stage. When your customer pool is large enough and your brand recognition solid enough, you will find that growth is no longer an immensely difficult task but happens naturally. It's like planting a tree. In the first year or two, it might grow very slowly because it's putting down roots. Once the root system is established and deep in the soil, the subsequent lush foliage and branches follow naturally and irresistibly.

**Conclusion**

Looking back on our journey today, we started from practical difficulties, traversed an analysis of the landscape, seized the opportunity of the times, identified a clear path, and finally glimpsed that promising future.

This path might start somewhat slowly, but remember, every step you take here is accumulating assets for yourself, adding bricks and tiles to your own digital city.

As a seller already on this path said: "The best time to plant a tree was ten years ago. The second best time is now."

I look forward to hearing your stories and gains from practice in the near future.

Thank you all.
